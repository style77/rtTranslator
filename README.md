## Installation

0. Set your loopback device as default device
1. Clone the repository
2. Change `config.py` to your liking
3. Install the requirements
4. Run `python -m app`

For now it's only working on windows, but I'm planning to make it cross-platform.
> YOU NEED A LOOPBACK DEVICE FOR THIS, I RECOMMEND [VB-CABLE](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/) WITH [VOICEMEETER](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/index.htm).

## Usage

Just run app and it will start listening for sound and translating it to text.
